# Useless #
This repository is the collections of the all useless-project you may think to write.
Without this project, you could write all of the codes by yourself.

## ROADMAP ##
This repository collections all my useless projects which one day could be move-out
to a single project, someday.

- *rootkit* : a simple but useless system rootkit.
- *packer-fantasy* : a simple but useless binary packer (based on Golang).
