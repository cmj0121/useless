# Useless #
This repository is the collections of the all useless-project you may think to write.
Without this project, you could write all of the codes by yourself.

## ROADMAP ##
This repository collections all my useless projects which one day could be move-out
to a single project, someday.

- [*rootkit*][0] : a simple but useless system rootkit.
- [*packer-fantasy*][1] : a simple but useless binary packer (based on Golang).
- [*tree*][2]: Go-lang based instance help library.
- [*parallel*][3]: the sample code for the parallel programming.
- [*DCard*][4]: Go-lang based DCard fetch library.
